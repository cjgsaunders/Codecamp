# Landing-page-demo.

My goal was to learn CSS Grid Layouts by building a simple page.

This project adheres to responsive web design with the content adjusting to fit the screen size.
CSS Grid allows the the responsive layout.
A single media query breakpoint was used to change to a sticky footer for wide screens. (white space appears under the footer on wide screens with no content to scroll)
