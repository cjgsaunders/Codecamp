# Landing-page-demo.

My goal was to learn CSS Grid Layouts by building a simple page.

This project adheres to responsive web design with the content adjusting to fit the screen size.

Recently I fixed white space appearing under the footer.
On wide screens the footer was not staying at the bottom of the screen.
I addressed this by changing to a sticky footer on wide screens.

Viewable on CodePen here.
